# Web Development Project 4 - *Veni-Vici App*

Submitted by: **Ruhi Sawant**

This web app: **Displays random country data with attributes like capital, region, language, and currency. Users can add or remove these attributes from a ban list, ensuring that future API calls do not show the banned attributes.**

Time spent: **14 hours spent in total**

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Application features a button that creates a new API fetch request on click and displays at least three attributes and an image obtained from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/data from API call response is viewable at a time and at least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **API call response results should appear random to the user**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**
- [x] _To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes_

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes are clickable and can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously displayed results from this session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Users can drag and drop country attributes into a ban list to filter future API results
* [x] Clear button to remove all attributes from the ban list

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
- Handling dynamic content updates from the API while ensuring proper handling of the ban list.
- Ensuring that drag-and-drop functionality is intuitive for users.
